Registration is completely optional since it will be performed automatically for you with sensible defaults. Useful if you want your application, with its own icon and types of notifications, to show up in Growl's prefence panel.\n\n  - `appname` the name of the application (required.)\n  - `appicon` url, file path, or Buffer instance for an application icon image.\n  - `notifications` a list of defined notification types with the following properties:\n    - `.label` name used to identify the type of notification being used (required.)\n    - `.dispname` name users will see in Growl's preference panel (defaults to `.label`.)\n    - `.enabled` whether or not notifications of this type are enabled (defaults to true.)\n  - `callback` called when the registration completes; if registration fails, the first argument will be an Error object.\n\nAn example:\n\n```javascript\ngrowly.register('My Application', 'path/to/icon.png', [\n    { label: 'success', dispname: 'Success' },\n    { label: 'warning', dispname: 'Warning', enabled: false }\n], function(err) {\n    console.log(err || 'Registration successful!');\n});\n```\n\n### Growly.notify(text, [opts], [callback]) ###\n\nSends a Growl notification. If an application wasn't registered beforehand with `growly.register()`, a default application will automatically be registered beforesending the notification.\n\n  - `text` the body of the notification.\n  - `opts` an object with the following properties:\n    - `.title` title of the notification.\n    - `.icon` url, file path, or Buffer instance for the notification's icon.\n    - `.sticky` whether or not to sticky the notification (defaults to false.)\n    - `.label` type of notification to use (defaults to the first registered notification type.)\n    - `.priority` the priority of the notification from lowest (-2) to highest (2).\n  - `callback` called when the user has closed/clicked the notification. The callback is passed an Error object `err` as the first argument when the notification fails; otherwise, the second argument `action` is a string that'll describe which action has been taken by the user (either 'closed' or 'clicked'.)\n\nAn example:\n\n```javascript\n/* Assuming an application was registered with a notification type labeled 'warning'. */\ngrowly.notify('Stuffs broken!', { label: 'warning' }, function(err, action) {\n    console.log('Action:', action);\n});\n```\n\n## License ##\n\nCopyright (C) 2012 Ibrahim Al-Rajhi <abrahamalrajhi@gmail.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
